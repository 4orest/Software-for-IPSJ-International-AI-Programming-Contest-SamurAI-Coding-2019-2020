    <h2>Game Field</h2>
    <p>
      The game field is divided into grid-aligned cells.
    </p>
    <h3>Agents</h3>
    <p>
      Four agents, one samurai and one dog for each side,
      are initially located on the four corners of the game field.
      Samurai can move to one of the <em>four</em> neighboring cells in
      one game step, while dogs can move to one of <em>eight</em>
      neighboring cells.
    </p>
    <img src="screenShots/holes.png" width="18%" class="figure">
    <h3>Holes</h3>
    <p>
      Initially, some of the cells in the game field are with a hole,
      to which game agents cannot step into.
      Holes are placed at random.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samurai can plug the hole in one of its four neighboring cells
      in stead of moving there, while dogs cannot.
    </p>
    <img src="screenShots/hidden-gold.png" width="25%" class="figure">

    <h3>Embedded Gold</h3>
    <p>
      Some randomly chosen cells have some amount of hidden embedded
      gold, which are hidden.
    </p>

    <h3>Random Reconfiguration</h3>
    <p>
      You can choose another randomly constructed field configuration
      by clicking the reinitialize button
      <img src="../icons/reinit.png" class="inlineIcon">
      on the upper left corner.
    </p>

    <h2>Automatic Play Mode</h2>
    <p>
      The initial play mode is <em>automatic.</em>
      In the automatic mode, the computer chooses the moves of the agents
      in each step.
    </p>
    <img src="screenShots/control-buttons.png" width="40%" class="figure">
    <p>
      The game progresses controlled using some of the buttons on the top.
      Buttons and their functions are as described below.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Clicking the left-most <em>reinitialize button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/reinit.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  will intialize the game with different random configuration.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Clicking the <em>rewind button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/rewind.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  that comes next
	  will initialize the game with the same configuration.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Clicking the <em>step backward button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/stepBackward.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  will show the game state of one step before the current.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Clicking the <em>play button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/play.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  starts automatic play.
	  The button changes its form to
	  <img src="../icons/stop.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  and the play will continue until this button is clicked,
	  all the embedded gold is dug out, or
	  the maximum number of steps is played.
	  The play speed can be adjusted using the <em>speedometer button</em>
	  explained below.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Cliking the <em>step forward button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/stepForward.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  plays a single step of automatic play.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Clicking the <em>fast forward button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/fastForward.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  will show the game state with the largest step number ever reached.
	  Note that this may not necessarily the final state of the game,
	  as that state may not have reached yet.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The <em>speedometer button</em>
	  <img src="../icons/speedometer.png" class="inlineIcon">
	  can be used to adjust the speed of automatic play.
	  The number displayed on its right indicates
	  the current play speed in steps per minute (spm, in short).
	  Clicking the speedometer will decrease the play speed by 4 spm.
	  If a shift key is pressed, it will increase by 4 spm.
	  Alternatively, moving a mouse wheel while the mouse cursor
	  is on the speedometer.
	  The maximum play speed is 240 spm and the minimum is 24.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Manual Play Mode</h2>
    <p>
      In the manual play mode, one of the two samurai can be
      controlled manually.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting the Manual Play</h3>
    <p>
      Clicking the <em>manual play button</em>
      <img src="../icons/manual.png" class="inlineIcon">
      on the top right changes the play mode to manual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first click on the button makes the red samurai controlled
      manually.  The button changes its color to red
      <img src="../icons/red-hand.png" class="inlineIcon">.
      All the other agents, dogs and the blue samurai, are
      still controlled by the computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another click makes the blue samurai under manually control,
      and changes the button color to blue
      <img src="../icons/blue-hand.png" class="inlineIcon">.
      The computer will start controlling the red samurai,
      as well as dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another click will revert the play mode to automatic,
      reverting the button color to the original.
    </p>
    <img src="screenShots/manual-play.png" width="20%" class="figure">
    <h3>Manual Stepping</h3>
    <p>
      When the play mode is manual, arrow symbols are displayed
      on cells around the manually controlled agent,
      showing possible plays.
      Arrows on cells with a hole outlined red.
      Clicking the cells marked with arrows tells the following.
      <ul>
	<li>
	  If a shift key is pressed when the cell is clicked,
	  the tried action is either plugging a hole or digging a new one,
	  depending on whether a hole is already there.
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      If the cell has a hole, the hole will be plugged up.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      If the cell is flat and has some embedded gold,
	      whether or not it is already revealed,
	      the samurai tries to dig it out.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      If the cell is flat and does not have any gold,
	      simply a new hole is dug out in the cell.
	    </li>
	    Digging will not be successful
	    if some other agent successfully moves on to that same cell.
	    When both samurai try to dig on the same cell,
	    digging will be successful, and gold embedded, if any,
	    will be halved and shared by two sides.
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	  If shift keys are <em>not</em> pressed when the cell is clicked,
	  the samurai tries to move onto that cell.
	  The action will be successful if the cell does not have a
	  hole and no other agents try to move to the same cell.
	</li>
      </ul>
      When the cell where the samurai stands is clicked,
      no actions are taken for that step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actions of the samurai can also be told by key presses.
      The keys and their meaning are as follows.
      <table>
	<tr>
	  <th><tt>h w &larr;</tt></th>
	  <td>Specifies the upper left cell (&nwarr;)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th><tt>j s &darr;</tt></th>
	  <td>Specifies the lower left cell (&swarr;)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th><tt>k n &uarr;</tt></th>
	  <td>Specifies the upper right cell (&nearr;)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th><tt>l e &rarr;</tt></th>
	  <td>Specifies the lowerright cell (&searr;)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <th><tt>.</tt> <em>space</em></th>
	  <td>Specifies to pause without any actions</td>
	</tr>
      </table>
      As with clicking on the screen.
      holding shift keys down tells digging a new hole or
      plugging an already existing hole.
    </p>
    <p>

      <img src="../icons/stepForward.png" class="inlineIcon">,
      automatic repetitive play by the play button
      <img src="../icons/play.png" class="inlineIcon">,
      and game initialization by the rewind button
      <img src="../icons/rewind.png" class="inlineIcon">
      are also possible in the manual play mode.
      When the play stops, the play mode is kept to be manual.
